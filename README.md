# Leaf Disease Detection with Deep Learning

This repository contains code for a leaf disease detection project using deep learning techniques. The project aims to automatically classify plant leaves as healthy or infected based on input images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Plant Disease Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset) from Kaggle. It consists of images of plant leaves categorized into three classes: "Healthy", "Powdery", and "Rust".

## Project Structure

- `Dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset divided into train, test, and validation sets.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, dataset, and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReapredatoR/Code_Alpha_Leaf_Disease_Detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Code_Alpha_Leaf_Disease_Detection
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
